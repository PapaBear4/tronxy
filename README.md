Tronxy X5SA config files

Factory config is what M8512??? read off the machine.

X5SA-PRO-24V-TLM8_V1.1.Gcode.gcode is what I downloaded from the Tronxy website as a "firmware" update.

Once running that I read it again with M???? and got back TronxyUpdatedConfig.gcode.  One interesting thing I noticed is that not all of the M-codes that were read in came back out again.  And the ones that were factory set, but not in the update, did not update.

The biggest reason that I started this was to try and "fix" the retraction settings.
